            "updates": "Welcome to Baby Guardian 240311 Developer Preview version, this is a pre-release version, I recommend every beta-tester updates the app. It includes latest UI change for large screen devices, foldables and Android TV. This release also adds a new \"PiP mode\", which means Picture in Picture mode, gives you an option to watch your baby even if you move to another app or back to screen. I have forced every tester to update the app because it is very important to see the state-of-the-art, especially in a group setting. Please update the App as instructed."
